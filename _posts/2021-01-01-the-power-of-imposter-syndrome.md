title: The power of imposter syndrome

Feeling unworthy of your accomplishments is a horrible feeling. It's also hard to separate an actual skills gap from how you see yourself. A solution can be found in a perceptive mentor, but it can be hard to find that honest relationship.

Nearly every designer I've known has talked about feeling unsure of their abilities, partly due to the huge range of skills that designers feel they should have (and sometimes are expected to have) ranging from information architecture and service design to marketing and copywriting.

I've also known people who are effortlessly confident, who laughed when we've talked about imposter syndrome. They had strong opinions and saw confidence as a big part of their job. It's usually a sign of greater personal insecurity and a need to fit into an environment that punishes weakness. In either case, I've kept my distance.

A healthy level of imposter syndrome is when it brings the feeling that you could do things better _and it motivates you to improve_. The problem comes when it's a crushing feeling, one that's discouraging and prevents you from changing or talking honestly.

Feeling like an imposter shows a level of self-awareness, curiosity and honesty. Leaning into the feelings of inadequacy and not having it overwhelm (a difficult balance) can bring positive effects such as strong preparation, seeing perspectives that others miss, learning new skills and having a healthy ego.

I hope we can normalise imposter syndrome to the point that the term disappears. It just becomes part of a healthy mindset, and we start to call out those who are blindly confident and complacent.
