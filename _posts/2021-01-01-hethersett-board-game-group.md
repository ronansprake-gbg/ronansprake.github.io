I've been thinking about creating a local board game group, so if you're looking for one, please message me (below) and let's make it happen!

I prefer small groups over the big ones in the city, and I imagine either the Social Club or King's/Queen's Head could host.

If you're not up for that, I heartily recommend the Mulbarton group, they meet ever other Sunday at their social club (Find the group on Facebook).
