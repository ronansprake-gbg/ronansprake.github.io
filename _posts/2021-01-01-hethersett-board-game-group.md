If you're searching for a board gaming group local to Hethersett, please message me (below) and let's make it happen!

I prefer small groups and I imagine either the Social Club or King's/Queen's Head could host.

Alternatively, I heartily recommend the Mulbarton group, they meet every other Sunday at 7pm (search for them on Facebook).
