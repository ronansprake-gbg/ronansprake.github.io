I've been thinking about creating a local board gaming group, so if you're searching for one, please message me (below) and let's make it happen!

I prefer small groups and I imagine either the Social Club or King's/Queen's Head could host - I can look into that.

Alternatively, I heartily recommend the Mulbarton group, they meet every other Sunday at 7pm (search for them on Facebook).
