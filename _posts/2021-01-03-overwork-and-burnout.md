title: Overwork & burnout
listingclass:

As a designer or developer, working nights and weekends can feel exciting at first, especially if it's something you believe in. It can bring a team together and it's often done out of pure necessity. And that's fine, but it's easily abused.

For starters, working long hours under the guise of team culture is bad. Those with equity telling those without equity to work long hours is also bad and it's often a sign of broken process, poor management and poor planning. You're financing someone else's business with your time.

If a company frequently requires you to work nights and weekends, I've no doubt theyâ€™d require you to work even more if there was magically more than 24 hours in a day. They're being greedy.

On the other hand, building something great often demands sacrifice and obsessive intensity. Over a limited crunch time, that's fine and can result in leaps of experience, reward and satisfaction but it's easy for this demand to creep into normal life.

Overwork can be fulfilling. Burnout occurs when there's no tangible payoff or end point. I've experienced this twice, both times were a result of grinding with no emotional reward or learning and a lack of personal care. When I wasn't working, I wasn't sleeping well, eating well, or looking after myself (the second time resulted in shingles ðŸ˜ž).

It's a vicious cycle.

Over time I've put together some questions to ask myself, including:

* What's the reward (financial, career, learning)?
* What's the sacrifice (personal and professional)?
* Is the work fulfilling?
* Will the end result make you proud?
* How does the team behave at the end, do they plough on or review and recover?

Disclaimer: The tech sector is notorious for forgetting about people with "real world" jobs - nurses, drivers, teachers - who would rightly roll their eyes at much of the above.
